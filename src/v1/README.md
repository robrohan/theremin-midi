# Theremin V1

This is an LSTM version of the midi generator. The initial code was taken from 
an RNN [tesnsorflow example](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/music_generation) 
and then modified.

I abandoned this version, but wanted to keep it around for reference and for
my future interest. It may still work if you install tensorflow, but 
consider it deprecated and not working.

You want the code in [../v2](../v2)
